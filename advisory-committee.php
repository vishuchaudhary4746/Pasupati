          <h4>Padma Shri Dr. Rajagopalan Vasudevan, an Indian scientist specializing in waste management, is renowned for his innovative method of 
          using plastic waste in road construction. Currently a professor at Thiagarajar College of Engineering, he developed a technique to shred plastic waste,
